          <br />
          PTE is a computer-based English language proficiency test. It assesses your ability to communicate effectively in English across all four language skills: speaking, writing, reading, and listening. Recognized by universities, colleges, and governments around the world, PTE provides an accurate assessment of your English language proficiency for academic, immigration, and professional purposes.
